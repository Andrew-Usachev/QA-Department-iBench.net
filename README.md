It's Final project for the iBench freelance searching platform.

We created many END-TO-END tests to cover absolutely every aspect
of the SDLC.

- We worked as a team of professionals making sure that every task 
is properly documented, assigned and executed. We used "JIRA" for that purpose .
- We created test documentation in form of "Word" document describing all important milestones 
as well as responsibilities, software and types of test we did in "GOOGLE Sheets".
- Main platform for creating Front-End tests and frameworks was Pycharm IDE Selenium based. 
We created our own framework that unifies testing process, makes it easier to execute and much faster. We called it "SELEN".  
- API tests we ran using "Postman" STT(Software testing tool). We created an Environment for continuous testing and 
possibility to add random values at the test parameters field. 
- For the Back - End testing we used "Visual Studio" and "Workbench". Tested for database response and 
how  it returns, stores and manage values inside. How data JOINS communicating and even some types of penetration tests.
Checking for data vulnerabilities is essential. 


More detailed information about our testing plan you can find in documentation folder.

(In our plans was to do tests in different environments using "Docker", 
Create CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing, we also tried different platforms for test case creation such as: Qase, Zephyr, 
or Test Colab, and finally to use JMeter for security testing). We leave it for the future projects as it requires 
some significant investment.
